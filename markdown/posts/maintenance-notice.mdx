# ðŸ“¢ Site Maintenance Notice

We want to inform you that DCL-Metrics will no longer be actively updated, as the public API we rely on has been discontinued. As a result, we are no longer able to pull the data required to keep the platform functional and up-to-date.

### What This Means

- The site will remain online in a cached state.
- All current content and data will still be viewable, but no new data or updates will be available.

### Thank You

We sincerely thank everyone who used and supported DCL-Metrics. Although this marks the end of active updates, we hope the existing content remains useful to some of you for reference or historical insights. If you have any questions or would like to get in touch, feel free to contact us at **dcl.metrics@gmail.com** or visit our [GitHub page](https://github.com/DCL-Metrics?type=source).

â€” The DCL-Metrics Team
